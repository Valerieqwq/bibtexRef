# Jabref-managed references

## Introduction

This is ``BibTex``/ ``BibLaTex`` references manager for my research, managed by the reference manager [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/).

This is a huge research project aimed at **recording all the papers and books** used for the researches. Even those encountered only once are recorded, too.
